# 42_ft_printf
About:

This is a project about replicating the original printf() function. 
We need to replicate it with some limitation in order to understand various concepts (variadic functions for example).

The function mimics the original function even tho it can only 
print integers, chars, strings, hexedicimals (upper and lowercase) and pointers.
